about the book
Spring AI in Action introduces the reader to building generative AI applications with Spring AI.
You’ll start with a simple “Hello AI world” example and quickly advance to more sophisticated techniques such
as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and enabling conversations with your project’s own documents and data.
You’ll love author and Spring legend Craig Walls’ practical example-driven approach with an emphasis
on getting stuff done.
